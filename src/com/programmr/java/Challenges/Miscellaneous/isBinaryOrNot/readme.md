# Check binary
A binary number is written as combination of 1's and 0's.
Binary number 100 indicates 4.

Write a program which accepts a number and prints whether it is binary or not.

### Example:

1) if user inputs 1040400
then it should print "Not Binary".

2) if user inputs 1000100
then it should print "Binary".
