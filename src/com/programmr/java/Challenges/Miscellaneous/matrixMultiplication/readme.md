# Matrix multiplication

Write a program to takes two matrix(3*3) array as inputs and calculate the multiplication of both matrix.
Use given logic for input/output.

### Example :
1. If two matrix are :

Matrix 1st :
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 1
```
Matrix 2nd:
```
1 2 3
3 2 1
4 5 2
```
then the multiplication of both matrix should be :
```
19 21 11
43 48 29
35 35 31
```
2. If two matrix are :

Matrix 1st :
```
4 4 4
2 2 2
3 3 3
```

Matrix 2nd :
```
1 4 3
3 2 4
1 2 4
```
then the multiplication of both matrix should be :
```
20 32 44
10 16 22
15 24 33
```
