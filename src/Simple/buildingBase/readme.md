# Building Base
> Source: [CheckIO](http://www.checkio.org)

The singularity has happened and we are being made to build the ideal robo-city for our overlords. In this shining
robotropolis, all buildings will be rectangular and all streets laid along south-north and east-west lines in a glorious
grid. Before we get started, we to create a class to represent the perfect building.
Because all the buildings in the city are rectangular and their walls are parallel to the streets, we can define any
building using only the coordinates of South-Western corner as two arguments (the length of the west to east walls, and
the length of the north to south wall) along with the height of the building. These values are described as positive
numbers using conventional units. **The origin point of our coordinate system lies in the South-West**, as a result the
northern corner ends up having the greater coordinate value than the southern corner. To complete this mission we need
to use a couple operations. See the class description below.

##### class **Building**(south, west, width_WE, width_NS, height=10)

> Returns a new Building instance with the South-West corner at [*south, west*] coordinates, the size is *width_WE*
 by *width_NS* and the height of the building is *height*. "height" is a positive number with a default value of 10.
>
> ```python
> >>> Building(10, 10, 1, 2, 2)
> Building(10, 10, 1, 2, 2)
> >>> Building(0, 0, 10.5, 2.546)
> Building(0, 0, 10.5, 2.546, 10)
> ```

##### corners()

> Returns a dictionary with the coordinates of the building corners. The dictionary has following keys: "north-west",
> "north-east", "south-west", "south-east". The values are lists or tuples with two numbers.
>
> ```python
> >>> Building(1, 2, 2, 2).corners()
> {"north-west": [3, 2], "north-east": [3, 4], "south-west": [1, 2], "south-east": [1, 4]}
> ```

##### area()

> Returns the area of the building.
> ```python
> >>> Building(1, 2.5, 4.2, 1.25).area()
> 5.25
> ```

##### volume()

> Returns the volume of the building.
> ```python
> >>> Building(1, 2.5, 4.2, 1.25, 101).volume()
> 530.25
> ```

##### __repr__()

> This is a string representation of the Building. This method is used for "print" or "str" conversion. Returns the
> string in the following view:
>
> "Building({south}, {west}, {width_we}, {width_ns}, {height})"
>
> ```python
> >>> str(Building(0, 0, 10.5, 2.546))
> "Building(0, 0, 10.5, 2.546, 10)"
> ```

In this mission all data will be correct and you don't need to implement value checking.
